# Introduction
A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently.

A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to data.

## Why learn data structure?
Almost every application we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way.

To efficiently manage that data, we need data structures

Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient organization of the books and they are stored randomly.

The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes comes down to the selection of the right data structure.

Data structures help you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory.

Learning about data structures also help us gain a more profound understanding of things we are already aware of.
    - DOM: it uses the Tree and data structures
    - Browser back and forward: it uses the Stack data structure
    - OS job scheduling: it uses the Queue data structure.

In this series of Data structures we will learn about the various types of data structures such as built-in structures `[Arrays, Objects, Sets, Maps]` and Custom data structures `[Stacks, Queues, Circular Queues, Linked list, Hash Table, Trees, Graphs]`.
