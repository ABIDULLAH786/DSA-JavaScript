# Object

An object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. The key must either be a string or symbol data type where as the value can be of any data type.

To retrieve a value, you can use the corresponding key. This can be achieved using the dot notation or bracket notation. The bracket notation is primarily used when the object key contains spaces e.g. `obj['first name']`.

An object is not an iterable. You cannot use it with a for of loop.
